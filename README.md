# HR Management
This is a side project I'm working on to improve my .NET skills.
Please feel free to contact me for a contribution using a pull request.
The project's about HR Management, which will allow an administrator to add new employees, add their absences and manipulate the types of absences (illness, marriage ...).
I'm also expecting to add a dashboard with ChartJS to show the % of absence of a selected employee.
Any Remark or suggestion is more than welcome !
